Got it 👍 here’s a short but still easy version:

* *git init* → Start Git in your folder so it can track changes.
* *git add* → Pick the files you want to save next.
* *git commit* → Save those files with a message (like a checkpoint).
* *git push* → Send your saved work to GitHub (online).

👉 Flow: *init → add → commit → push*.

Do you want me to make this into a *1-line story/analogy* so you can remember faster?
