# Knowledge Log

1. How a Node.js app is built and how it handles tasks one by one (event loop).
2. Using *npm* to add tools/packages your project needs.
3. Basic Git steps: start a repo, add files, save changes, send online, and make branches.
4. Using the *terminal* to run code and handle files.
5. Why it’s important to keep your project organized and write a simple README.

If you want, I can also make it *even shorter, one-line per point* so it’s super easy to remember.
